# Vagrant DSP

Quickly get an DreamFactory instance up for development and testing

## Getting started

Before you start, ensure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed and working.

1. `git clone https://github.com/jschwartz73/vagrant-dsp.git`
2. `cd vagrant-dsp`
3. `vagrant up`

That's it! The VM will be created and all the necessary software will download and configure DSP for you.  Everything is setup to mirror the installation instructions on the DSP wiki http://wiki.dreamfactory.com/wiki/Vagrant/Create_VM

DSP will be available on port 8080 of `localhost` by default.
